# Placement Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict whether a student will get placed in a job or not based on various factors using logistic regression.

## Overview

The project involves building a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict job placement for students. The model takes into account several features such as educational qualifications, skill assessments, gender, etc., to make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model contains information about students including their academic performance, skill ratings, gender, etc. Each row in the dataset represents a student, and the target variable indicates whether the student got placed or not.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:


## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the Streamlit app
4. Input the required information such as academic performance, skill ratings, gender, etc.
5. Click on the "Submit" button to see the prediction.

## Model Training

The logistic regression model is trained using the `LogisticRegression` class from scikit-learn. The dataset is preprocessed, and features are scaled before training the model.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporating additional features for better prediction accuracy.
- Experimenting with other machine learning algorithms.
- Improving the user interface for better user experience.
